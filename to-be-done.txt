Small bug when doing a mobius in planetary mode, the pole axis does not stay in the x-z plane (restored only when rotating the sphere with the mouse, creating a saccade).
In fact in free mode the pole axis also moves under a mobius. There is no saccade there but it would look better if it did not move. Some analysis is required here.
Proposed solution: to change slightly the mobius model. This will make mobius zooming much simpler anyway. Commit first!

Why does the FF console complain about syntax error on the beginning of each shader?

Global changes: make it more cross-browser.

Map adjuster? (heavy)

Lightweight standalone versions.

Bug? Reset mobius in extreme case may have to reset also RotMat
