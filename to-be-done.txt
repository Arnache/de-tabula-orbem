Small bug when doing a mobius in planetary mode, the pole does not stay vertical (restored only when rotating the sphere with the mouse, creating a saccade).

Put js code (vars and funcs) in a function, to avoid var name conflicts when using with other js libraries, and to turn it into a functionnality.

Global changes: make it more cross-browser.

Map adjuster? (heavy)

Lightweight standalone versions.
