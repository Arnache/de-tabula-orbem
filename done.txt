Mobius now controlled by the mousewheel instead of click + mouse y-move.
Option to switch mouse-wheel control from perspective to mobius.
Mousewhee sensitivity factor control.
Found a way to slow things down if mousewheel event is due to wheel instead of trackpad.
Moved "sphere at infinity" and "F.O.V" in the mousewheel <fieldset>

changed parseFloat(str,10) to parseFloat(str) everywhere

Added comments in the fragment shaders that describe the projection.
