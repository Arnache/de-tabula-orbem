Mobius now controlled by the mousewheel instead of click + mouse y-move.
Option to switch mouse-wheel control from perspective to mobius.
Mousewhee sensitivity factor control.
Found a way to slow things down if mousewheel event is due to wheel instead of trackpad.
Moved "sphere at infinity" and "F.O.V" in the mousewheel <fieldset>

changed parseFloat(str,10) to parseFloat(str) everywhere

Added comments in the fragment shaders that describe the projection.

Put js code (vars and funcs) in a function, to avoid var name conflicts when using with other js libraries, and to turn it into a functionnality.

Added a math.txt file explaining a bit of the math (matrix stuff for the moment).

Corrected Oren Nayar for case persp is not 0.

Small bug when doing a mobius in planetary mode, the pole axis did not stay in the x-z plane (restored only when rotating the sphere with the mouse, creating a saccade).
In fact in free mode the pole axis also moved under a mobius.
Solution: changed slightly the mobius model. This made mobius zooming much simpler anyway.
